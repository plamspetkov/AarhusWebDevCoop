        <articleTitle><![CDATA[Local SEO Strategies and Techniques]]></articleTitle>
        <articleContent><![CDATA[<p>Local SEO is a subset of the search engine optimization strategies. It is about optimizing for geographically-specific search. It includes a dizzying array of tasks including registration in business directories, listing in search engine local directories, attracting incoming links from local sources, and many other tasks.</p>
<h3><strong>Optimization strategies to make your SEO local</strong></h3>
<hr />
<p>There are two kinds of optimization strategies that go into making SEO local. One is on-site, the other is off-site. <strong>On-site SEO strategies</strong> generally refer to strategies that are implemented within the web programming language, and appear on the website itself. These can include strategies to aid search engines in indexing and ranking the website in question, as well as encourage visits, especially repeat visits. <strong>Off-site SEO strategies</strong> are all those SEO strategies that are implemented off-site, such as those which incorporate third-party websites. Many off-site SEO strategies involve driving traffic to the website; however, some involve enhancing a website’s overall visibility in search results, while others involve enhancing its index-ability by search engine crawlers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Citations</strong></h3>
<hr />
<p>“Citations” is important for improving the overall search engine ranking of your site. It is really important to understand the definition and application of “Citations”.</p>
<p>Citations are essentially data references to your business name, address, telephone or other pertinent data which can appear on website pages, other than your own website.These are one of Google’s optimization factors that you should not neglect, because if implemented properly, citations can be the main factor for your website to be shown or not. For example, if two websites have almost the same SEO values, the website with the most citations will most likely be ranked higher and therefore will be more visible in certain search engine results.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Online Reviews</strong></h3>
<hr />
<p>In today’s digital age, Most of the customers are likely influenced by online reviews in buying their decisions.</p>
<p>Online reviews are important for a number of reasons, and have major implications through their ability to affect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your rankings in local search engines</li>
<li>Which search results actually gets clicked on</li>
<li>Consumers purchasing decisions</li>
</ul>
<p>That makes online reviews as critical to your local SEO strategy as building citations and on-site optimization.</p>
<p>To further improve the presentation and visibility of your web pages in the search results you can add rich snippets to your website. Using structured markup on your web pages you can make it easier for humans and search engines, such as Google, to establish the nature of your content.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Google My Business/Google Places</strong></h3>
<hr />
<p>Google My Business (formerly Google Places) is one of the strategies if you want to succeed at local SEO.Google My Business puts your business info on Search, Maps and Google+ so that customers can find you, no matter what device they’re using. Give customers the right info at the right time, whether that be driving directions to your business in Maps, hours of operations in Search or a phone number they can click to call you on mobile phones.Your customers can show their appreciation with ratings and reviews, use the +1 button to endorse your content, and re-share your Google+ posts across the web.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Social media</strong></h3>
<hr />
<p>And last but not the least; don’t forget social media as part of your efforts to make your SEO local. SEO and social media go hand-in-hand and there’s a good reason why. Social signals are factored into the ranking algorithm and can help to boost search engine rankings if you can leverage them correctly. Social media will give you a chance to engage with your customers. Tell them what you’re doing, show off your products or special offers, and answer their questions and concerns.</p>]]></articleContent>

        <articleTitle><![CDATA[Adaptive vs. Responsive Web Design]]></articleTitle>
        <articleContent><![CDATA[<div class="om-c-container">
<div class="om-c-container-inner">
<p>How do we deal with this tectonic shift in user behavior? We’ve moved beyond the era of m-dot or t-dot hacks, into one where responsive and adaptive design techniques rule the day — what the W3C calls a One Web approach. The key part of the W3C’s recommendation is that “One Web means making, as far as is reasonable, the same information and services available to users irrespective of the device they are using.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For a developer that means that taking a One Web approach ensures that not only does your site work on the smartphones and tablets of today, but it can be future-proofed for the unimagined screens of tomorrow.</p>
<p>There are currently three popular approaches to developing a One Web site: using a responsive design; client-side adaptive designs; and server-side adaptive designs.</p>
<p>One is not better or worse than the other; each has its own strengths and weaknesses and the wise web developer will consider the benefits and drawbacks of each before picking the one that works for their next project.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Responsive Web Design</h3>
<hr />
<p>Responsive web design is the most common One Web approach. The approach uses CSS media queries to modify the presentation of a website based on the size of the device display. The number of responsive sites is rapidly increasing, from the Boston Globe to Disney to Indochino.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A key advantage of this approach is that designers can use a single template for all devices, and just use CSS to determine how content is rendered on different screen sizes. Plus, those designers can still work in HTML and CSS, technologies they’re already familiar with. Additionally, there’s a growing number of responsive-friendly, open-source toolkits like Bootstrap or Foundation which help simplify the process of building responsive sites.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The design and testing phase can be quite fussy, as it can be difficult to customize the user experience for every possible device or context. We’ve all seen responsive site layouts that look like a bunch of puzzle pieces that don’t quite fit together. Responsive web design works best in combination with a mobile-first approach, where the mobile use case is prioritized during development. Progressive enhancement is then used to address tablet and desktop use cases.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The numbers are that high because a responsive approach covers all devices. Your user is only using one device, but they have to wait for all of the page elements and resources to load before they can use it. Put simply, performance affects your bottom line. On smartphones, the conversion rate drops by an extra 3.5 percent when users have to wait just one second. By the three second mark, 57 percent of users will have left your site completely.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While responsive design is fast becoming the de facto standard, it also creates new challenges for online businesses, including how to handle images, how to optimize mobile performance and often means sites need to be rebuilt from the ground up with a mobile first approach.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Client-Side Adaptive</h3>
<hr />
<p>Adaptive design builds on the principles of responsive design to deliver user experiences that are targeted at specific devices and contexts. It uses JavaScript to enrich websites with advanced functionality and customization. For example, adaptive websites deliver Retina-quality images only to Retina displays (such as the new iPad) while standard-definition displays receive lower-quality images.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are two approaches to adaptive design — one where the adaptations occur on the client side, in the user’s browser, and another where the web server does the heavy lifting of detecting various devices and loading the correct template. Examples of client-side adaptive sites include Threadless and Ideeli. One of the strengths of the adaptive templating approach is the ability to reuse one set of HTML and JavaScript across devices, simplifying change management and testing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A client-side adaptive approach means you don’t have to rebuild your site from the ground up. Instead you can build on existing content while still delivering a mobile-responsive layout. For expert developers, this approach also enables you to specifically target particular devices or screen resolutions. For example, for many of Mobify’s online fashion retail clients, 95% of their mobile traffic comes from iPhones. Client-side adaptive means they can optimize specifically for Apple Smartphone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unlike responsive design, adaptive templates ensure that only the required resources are loaded by the client’s device. Because device and feature detection is shifted to the mobile device itself, CDN networks like Akamai and Edgecast can use most of their caching functionality without disrupting the user experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The client-side adaptive approach has a higher barrier to entry than responsive design. Developers need to have a solid grasp of JavaScript to use this technique. It also depends on a site’s existing templates as the foundation. Finally, because the client-side adaptations are a kind of layer on top of your existing code base, you need to maintain them as your site as a whole evolves.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Server-Side Adaptive</h3>
<hr />
<p>We can achieve the server-side adaptive approach in a variety of ways, through server-side plug-in and custom user agent detection. Sites that use server-side adaptive include Etsy, One Kings Lane and OnlineShoes.com.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why choose server-side adaptive? It typically offers distinct templates for each device, enabling more customization, and it keeps device-detection logic on the server, enabling smaller mobile pages that load faster. Additionally, there are numerous server-side plug-ins available for common CMS and e-commerce systems such as Magento.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Of course, many companies are still wrestling with the basics of responsive, and they’re not ready to confront the more sophisticated flavors of adaptive. Increasingly, competition and mobile traffic, however, will drive more and more organizations to kick the tires on all three approaches, and pick the one that works best for their users.</p>

        <articleTitle><![CDATA[The Impact of Social Media in SEO]]></articleTitle>
        <articleContent><![CDATA[<div class="post-content post-content-full">
<div class="om-c-container">
<div class="om-c-container-inner">
<p>Social media is a great way to measure what real people think about a particular website. The search engines are able to pick up on this and use this information to help determine how the website should be ranked. The following will show the impact of Social Media in SEO;<br /><span id="more-3732"></span></p>
<h3>Social Links May or May Not Boost Your Search Rank</h3>
<hr />
<p>Okay, social signals pertaining to a profile’s authority is out, but does Google consider links published on social accounts to be credible backlinks? When a blog post goes viral on Twitter, do those new links boost the post’s search ranking?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many marketers believe that links to your website via social media accounts do have a major impact on your rankings.</p>
<h3>Social Media Profiles Rank in Search Engines</h3>
<hr />
<p>While social shares may or may not affect a webpage’s position in search listings, your social profiles definitely influence the content of your search results. In fact, social media profiles are often amongst the top results in search listings for brand names. When I searched “General Electric” in Google, the company’s Instagram and Pinterest profiles appeared as the 5th and 6th listings, respectively, and Twitter was the 8th result.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Social channels can feel more personal than webpages, and they’re a great way to get a sense of a company’s personality off the bat. When I’m researching a company I don’t know much about I typically go straight to their Twitter or Facebook page. So if a social account shows up at the top of the search results, I’m just as likely to click on it as I would be to click on their website.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There’s no doubt that your social profiles matter to Google and especially to people who are looking for you online. A few active social channels can make the experience of getting to know your brand online more fun, engaging and personal. Also, while some may consider Google+ a non-essential social channel, marketers shouldn’t discount the fact that a company’s Google+ profile is one of the first things a searcher will see (and potentially click on). As such, it pays to have a profile with up-to-date info and engaging content.</p>
<h3>Social Media Channels Are Search Engines, Too</h3>
<hr />
<p>Nowadays, people don’t just go to Google and Bing to look stuff up; they also use social media channels to find what they’re looking for</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This works in a couple of ways: First, if you’re active on Twitter, it’s entirely possible that people will discover your company’s new content distribution app after searching for content marketing-related tweets with Twitter’s search engine. Likewise, brands that lend themselves to beautiful visual content can benefit from making their content visible in Pinterest and Instagram by using hashtags and properly categorizing their pins.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moreover, as mentioned in point #1, if someone wants to check out your company, they’re likely to open Twitter and Facebook and do a quick search to see what kind of presence you have on each channel. YouTube, and, of course, Google+ are also search engines.</p>
<h3>Not Now Doesn’t Mean Not Ever</h3>
<hr />
<p>Just because Google says that social signals don’t currently impact search rank doesn’t mean they never will. Social media shows no sign of becoming a less important part of a brand or person’s online presence anytime soon; moreover, given that link-building strategies like guest blogging have become a less reliable way to indicate the quality of a webpage, it makes sense that search engines would begin to look for other signals of authority and value.</p>
<h3>Don’t Forget Bing</h3>
<hr />
<p>Google may have back-tracked and changed their stance on social signals, but I haven’t found any evidence that what Bing told Sullivan for his Search Engine Watch interview doesn’t hold true today.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Google’s search algorithm ignores social signals should not be seen as an invitation for marketers to dismiss social’s impact on SEO. Instead, marketers should broaden their concept of search and SEO to take into account the myriad ways that people find content on the web. They also need to think about the positive effects that increased traffic from social can potentially have on their search rankings as well as the prominence of social profiles on first-page search results.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ultimately, the web is all about building relationships, fostering audiences, expressing identity and sharing ideas––it’s inherently social, and there’s no reason that SEO best practices would go against the grain, especially since the rules that govern SEO are ultimately meant to make the web a more enjoyable and useful place.</p>

        <articleTitle><![CDATA[Reasons Why We Give Importance to Visual Content]]></articleTitle>
        <articleContent><![CDATA[<div class="om-c-container">
<div class="om-c-container-inner">
<p>In creating a website, we should prioritize the objective of attracting visitors and make them stay longer in our website. It is important that we can get their attention and hook them up in accessing and browsing our site. In our present world of digital media, netizens are obsessed in Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, etc. where Visual Content, Infographics and Photography plays a main role in sustaining visitors to our website.<span id="more-3709"></span>This is how marketing online is changing and how images and visuals are taking over. Here are some reasons why we should give importance to Visual Content;</p>
<ol>
<li>90% of information transmitted to the brain is visual. Visuals are processed 60,000X faster in the brain than text. This means any information you want to communicate is better communicated in the form of an image. It also means that, for an internet user skimming the web (or your website) you’ll be able to communicate more value, quicker.</li>
<li>Videos on landing pages increase average page conversion rates by 86%. It’s also worth noting that many A/B Tests have found similar conversion rate increases from simple images.</li>
<li>Visual content is social-media-ready and social-media-friendly. It’s easily sharable and easily palatable. Social engagement is already (thanks to the Hummingbird update to Google’s algorithm) becoming more important for your business’ SEO. Images on social media get more engagement than links or text. Images on your website have a higher chance of being shared than anything else. Visual content is just smart business.</li>
<li>Businesses who market with infographics grow in traffic with an average of 12% more than those who don’t.Infographics are a visually appealing way to communicate information quickly and easily to your audience. Businesses with a graphic designer working in their marketing department can create a short infographic quickly and easily. Infographics are not only awesome for brand awareness and social-media sharing, they’re also referenced more frequently than any other pieces of content – increasing their reach exponentially.</li>
<li>Posts with visuals receive 94% more page visits and engagement than those without. People are naturally more attracted to images than they are links or text. Facebook posts with an image receive, on average, more than twice as many comments as those without. Photo albums on Facebook receive 180% more engagement than a normal post.</li>
<li>60% of consumers are more likely to click on a business whose images appear in search results. Basically this means you need to find a way to show your products with an image. For SaaS (Software as a Service) or B2B (Business to Business) companies, this may be an icon or your logo. Try alt tagging these images with your product name, so it would be easier for search engines to rank your image above your competitors.</li>
<li>67% of consumers consider clear, detailed images to carry more weight than product information or customer ratings. Surprised by that statistic? It’s not the only one I’ve got. In from an article in The Psychology Behind a Successful Facebook Ad Part 2: A Harvard student worked with a South African bank, sending 50,000 letters offering short term loans. They varied the interest rate as well as included psychologically-influential cues. It turned out that having a wholesome, happy female picture in a corner of the letter had as much positive impact on the response rate as dropping the interest rate by four percentage points.</li>
<li>Visuals show your products without telling people about them. This allows viewers to make their own decisions without feeling pressure from your business. One of the chief complaints by online users is the constant badgering they receive from brands. Advertisements dog their mobile apps, social networks, searches, etc. Any way you can promote your business without spamming your audience should be pursued and invested</li>
</ol>
<p>We have seen a rise in visual content, and a decrease in the reign of info-heavy, fact-heavy blog articles. Photo editing tools are easier to use, and people are slowly but surely noticing how much brand engagement they stand to receive if they can communicate with images rather than words (or both).</p>
<p>So try using more images and infographics to help make it easier for your market to understand your message.</p>

        <articleTitle><![CDATA[Web Design for Mobile Devices]]></articleTitle>
        <articleContent><![CDATA[<div class="om-c-container">
<div class="om-c-container-inner">
<p>We have seen a lot of Web Developers and designers are now working into a mobile-first approach. This method is necessarily used for commonly and highly accessible smart phones. However this approach has more to offer in terms of the process.<br /><span id="more-3648"></span><br />Mobile First Approach is designing the content, layout and navigation of the website for a mobile device before designing the version for the Desktop at a much wider screen. The main objective of this method is to consider a much less real estate displays of mobile devices compared to a much larger desktop screen. By doing this, you can concentrate more on the content rather than giving more weight on the graphics or visual designs. The main priority in this approach is to have a website that can be ideally responsive with a good content for smart phone users. But this does not mean that you are going to take for granted the visual design. You just have to take into consideration the hierarchy of the demand of users based on their preferred gadgets. Nowadays a good balance of content, visual design plus the mobile-first approach with a responsive user experience are the main ingredients in creating a successful site.</p>
<h2>Is it a must, to do a mobile-first approach?</h2>
<p>The answer will always be depending on the type of website and how it is being used. In mobile, you are more of seeing the content than that much of the visual design and graphics. However, content is not just the text and information. It also includes pictures and other features which pertain on how the user gets the information in the most responsive manner especially when they are using their mobile devices.</p>
<p>By the end of 2015, analyst believed that mobile traffic will surpass the desktop traffic in terms of accessing websites. Web designer should start considering the points on how they can improve the site and make it easier for mobile user to navigate and get information from their designed sites. The keyword should be “Website Versatility”. A way in which user can easily access and navigate the site in the variety of devices they want to use, whether it’s a mobile, a tablet or in a Desktop.</p>
<p>Change is really inevitable especially in technology, we just have to adapt to the current situation to survive and be in sync. What is happening in web design right now is not just a trend that will gradually be extinct in few years time. Content and design would always be the heart and soul of every web design. What designers would have to do is to balance these ingredients to come up with a site which is accessible to a mobile browser as well as good and as responsive for Desktop users.</p>

<p id="3476" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This template offers many different layouts and challenges that a web developer may encounter in the real world. This forces new learners to think for themselves and delve into new technologies like flex box and floats to gain confidence in CSS layout techniques.

Creating a small quiz game is a really great place to start. It drills in <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://callmenick.com/post/basics-javascript-dom-manipulation" target="_blank" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="http://callmenick.com/post/basics-javascript-dom-manipulation">DOM manipulation</a>, as well as being a creative way to show your personality.

<p>JavaScript Quiz Game to find you the grilled cheese of your dreams.</p>
<p id="01d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Start with creating a simple game that asks 4 multiple choice questions. Using those questions, assign them a value which will point to an outcome. You’ll learn a lot about data management and creating a scoring system in programming. Don’t spend too much time focusing on the design of what you’re creating. I would even suggest getting familiar with a CSS framework that takes care of the styling for you during this project. Remember, if your goal is to become a better web developer, leave the designing for the professionals.</p>

<p>My horribly designed Giphy web app. You can do better, or use a CSS framework. 👍</p>
<p id="e2f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">An excellent beginning application to build is a basic re-creation of the the <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://giphy.com/" target="_blank" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://giphy.com/">giphy website</a>, using the <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://api.giphy.com/" target="_blank" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://api.giphy.com/">giphy api</a> itself. I recommend their API for beginners because there is no need to request any kind of API key, and you won’t have to worry about much configuration when trying to request data.</p>
<p id="d1d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Using their API you are able to build a small web app which does the following;</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="e163" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">displays trending gifs on app load shown in a column/grid</li>
<li id="2d96" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">has an input which allows you to search for specific gifs</li>
<li id="6fce" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">at the bottom of the results, there is a ‘load more’ button, which gets more gifs using that search term.</li>
</ul>
<p id="5e3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">You’ll hit a lot of new challenges in this project, one of which will be working with <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Synchronous_and_Asynchronous_Requests" target="_blank" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Synchronous_and_Asynchronous_Requests">asynchronous requests</a>. You can choose to use vanilla JavaScript for this challenge, or if you’re more comfortable with jQuery use the it’s <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/" target="_blank" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/">ajax method</a>. The goal is to begin working with asynchronous code.</p>
<p id="4d5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As your application begins to get more complex, you’ll also need to think about where you put data within your app and how you organize it. For this, I recommend making use of a architectural pattern called <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/12/07/namespacing-in-javascript/" target="_blank" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/12/07/namespacing-in-javascript/">name spacing</a> to help battle <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://toddmotto.com/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-javascript-scope/" target="_blank" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://toddmotto.com/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-javascript-scope/">scope</a> and conflicts with <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures" target="_blank" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures">closures</a>.</p>

        <projectDescription><![CDATA[<p id="25c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, your last project will be to continue to work with an API. The <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://punkapi.com/" target="_blank" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://punkapi.com/">punk api</a> (similar to the giphy API) doesn’t require a key to use and provides a lot of information in its responses.</p>
<p id="4d55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I would recommend creating a similar app to giphy in layout, but one which allows you to have a ‘shopping cart’ or ‘favourite’ functionality. You should then be able to see a separate list of the items you favourited. This will of course not be saved to any database, but will bring a new set of challenges with managing application state.</p>

<p>Beer web app with favouriting functionality.</p>
<p id="2720" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I would recommend diving into a front-end framework to expand your ability and general understanding over modern web development. Because I work heavily with <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">Facebook’s React</a> I would recommend starting that, and using <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app" target="_blank" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app">react create app</a> to get started.</p>
<p id="00ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This might seem like a giant leap at first, but focus on building this web app piece by piece. Create the app in the following order;</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="9529" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Template data on the page from a generic API request</li>
<li id="3aae" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Add a search bar, which makes a separate query to a database on request</li>
<li id="0e3f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">add favourite functionality which allows you to favourite a card</li>
<li id="9e98" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">create a separate route (using <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router" target="_blank" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" data-href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">react router</a>) which allows you to see all the beers you’ve favourited in the session.</li>
</ul>
<p id="4b90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Solving these problems one step at a time will help you feel less overwhelmed and more like you’re heading in a specific direction. Lastly, I find it best to eliminate styling from the equation when developing web apps and using a CSS framework. I chose to use <a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://bulma.io/" target="_blank" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="http://bulma.io/">Bulma</a> for my example, but there are many options out there for you to explore!</p>
